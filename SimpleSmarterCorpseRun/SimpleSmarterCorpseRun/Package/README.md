This mod removes some annoyances and inconsistencies from the runback after a death.


## Smarter 'Corpse Run' buff:

Instead of always giving 150 carrying capacity, the 'Corpse Run' buff now gives you as much bonus carrying capacity as you had when you died.

When you then put back on your items like your Megingjord, 'Corpse Run' will remove its part from the bonus carrying capacity buff, so your total stays the same and you don't get overburdened when the buff runs out.

If you did not have any such item when you died, 'Corpse Run' will not give you any bonus carrying capacity, so you don't get overburdened when the buff runs out.

So now the only way to get overburdened is to not put back on your items at all before the buff runs out.

It also works with modded items, tested:
- the backpacks from [Adventure Backpacks](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Vapok/AdventureBackpacks/)
- the backpacks from [Jude's Equipment](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/GoldenJude/Judes_Equipment/)


## Smarter Tombstone:

When interacting with your tombstone, checking if you have enough carrying capacity to automatically pick it all up will now include the bonus carrying capacity that 'Corpse Run' will give you. So if it all fit before, then it will always fit afterwards!

Additionally, the tombstone will now attempt to first quick stack any items that you collected on your naked runback into your tombstone, so, if possible, all items can return to the positions they were at when you died.
