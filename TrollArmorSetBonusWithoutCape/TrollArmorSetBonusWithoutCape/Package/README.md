This mod turns the troll armor set bonus into a 3 piece set and optionally gives the troll hide cape water resistance.

Parts of this mod are included in two of my new mods, this standalone release mostly serves for search engine optimization and modularity.
It is fully included in my new mod 'Cape and Torch Resistance Changes - Water and Cold Resistance" (so only install one of them).
The set bonus changes are also included in my new mod 'Simple New Set and Cape Bonuses', but you can still install this for the water resistance.

Set bonus change:

The troll armor set bonus is now a 3 piece set, allowing for the use of a different cape without losing the bonus.
I recommend the mod [SNEAKer](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/2093) for an even better set bonus.

Movement speed change:

The troll hide cape now grants 5% movement speed (configurable).

Water resistance:

If you install [Custom Armor Stats](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1162), then this mod will add water resistance to the troll hide cape.

You can configure the strength of the resistance:
- being resistant to water makes you dry off faster
- being very resistant means you can only get wet from swimming and not the rain
- immunity makes you immune to the wet debuff
