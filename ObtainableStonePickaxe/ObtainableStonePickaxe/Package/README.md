This mod adds the cut stone pickaxe item and makes it and the antler pickaxe upgradeable.

This item was cut from Valheim because it was replaced with the antler pickaxe. Now this mod adds it back in as a pre Eikthyr pickaxe to destroy those pesky rocks in your base.


## Stone pickaxe

This mod repairs the half broken state of the stone pickaxe and enables its existing crafting recipe that it was supposed to originally have. It can be crafted by hand for 10 stone and 3 wood and can be upgraded at the work bench (like the stone axe).

The stone pickaxe is not as strong as the antler pickaxe though. It can only break any kind of rock or terraform the ground. It cannot break copper, tin or anything else.


## Upgrading

This mod allows you to upgrade the stone pickaxe and the antler pickaxe. It can also fix an inconsistency when upgrading the bronze pickaxe, where it would gain one less pickaxe damage than pierce damage per level, unlike all other pickaxes.
