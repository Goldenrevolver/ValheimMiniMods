This mod changes teleporting with a portal to instantly update the weather on arrival, and optionally removes wet, cold and freezing debuffs at the end of the teleport.

This mod is a standalone version of the teleporting changes from my other new mod 'Cape and Torch Resistance Changes - Water and Cold Resistance" (so only install one of them).

Changes:

In the base game, the weather takes a few seconds to update after teleporting, because the transition period used for normal biome transition still gets applied. This mod changes that:
- Teleporting with a portal now immediately updates the weather at the new location, so you don't get wet from rain that doesn't exist
- Optionally removes wet, cold and freezing debuffs at the end of the teleport
