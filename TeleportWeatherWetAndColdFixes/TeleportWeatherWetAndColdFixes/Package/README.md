This mod changes teleporting with a portal to instantly update the weather on arrival, and optionally removes wet, cold and freezing debuffs at the end of the teleport.

This mod is a standalone version of the teleporting changes from my other new mod [Cape And Torch Resistance Rework - New Water And Cold Resistance](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Cape_And_Torch_Resistance_Rework_And_New_Water_And_Cold_Resistance/) (so only install one of them).


## Features:

In the base game, the weather takes a few seconds to update after teleporting, because the transition period used for normal biome transition still gets applied. This mod changes that:
- Teleporting with a portal now immediately updates the weather at the new location, so you don't get wet from rain that doesn't exist
- Optionally removes wet, cold and freezing debuffs at the end of the teleport
