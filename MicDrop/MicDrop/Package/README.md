This mod removes the forced throw when the player drops an item and changes the drop position based on configurable options.

Don't throw those eggs! Carefully drop them.

Configure to remove the throw:
- when **crouching**
- when holding a **hotkey**
- at all other times

Change the drop position for each condition:
- from your **right hand**
- at **chest** level
- at your **feet**
- a meter in front of you

With the default settings, it **normally** drops at **chest** level, but drops at your **feet** while **crouching**.
