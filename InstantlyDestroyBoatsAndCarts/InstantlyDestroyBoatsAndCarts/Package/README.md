This mod allows you to instantly destroy a boat/ ship or cart with the destroy function of the hammer.

We were all confused the first time when we couldn't do it, then took out an axe and did it the old fashioned way. I was confused for a second time, when I found out that the base game already has functionality if a boat or cart should currently be destroyable by a hammer. It was just disabled. This mod reenables and fixes that logic.

You can destroy a boat/ship when:
- noone is on it
- optionally only when the chest is empty

You can destroy a cart when:
- noone is currently pulling it
- optionally only when the chest is empty


Changelog: Fixed carts only being destroyable while in use, instead of while not being in use, whoops!
