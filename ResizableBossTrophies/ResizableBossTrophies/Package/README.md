This mod allows you to resize
- all boss trophies. The base values make them all about the same size
- most of the bigger trophies. If you want more, let me know

I already divided the config into sections based on biomes, in case I add every trophy in the future.

The lox trophy floating is a base game issue, scaling just makes it a bit more obvious. I don't care enough about it to fix it.


This mod is basically a lightweight mini version of [Item Stand All Items](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/Item_Stand_All_Items/), so check it out if you want more than this.


Backstory:

Right before the mistlands update, I built a trophy hall. I killed every boss again to get a duplicate trophy, and grinded for the last normal ones we were missing. Then I placed them all and... why is the Elder trophy so small? So I put a note in my modding ideas list "bigger elder trophy". Now that I finally got around to it, I was like "why not add a config file to resize them all" and that's what this mod is.


If you think that the effect of the Elder power is a bit weak, check out my other new mod [Better Elder Buff](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Better_Elder_Buff/).
