This mod changes the Yagluth boss altar to only require three items. It also does the same for the Eikthyr altar.

Whether it's for consecutive playthroughs or your first one, Yagluth's altar requiring five items to use instead of three felt a bit much to me. So this mod changes that, including updating the visuals to match. It also adds one more deer throphy to Eikthyr to fit the theme, but I'm sure you won't mind that.

This mod:
- is required to be installed on the server and by all clients
- can be uninstalled at any time and all altars will revert back automatically (there are no permanent changes) 
- does not update an altar that has a summoning item in one of the two removed slots. Instead, interacting with it will drop the items and then remove the two slots.
