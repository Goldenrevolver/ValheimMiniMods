This mod changes the Yagluth boss altar to only require three items. It optionally also affects Eikthyr and Bonemass.

Whether it's for consecutive playthroughs or your first one, Yagluth's altar requiring five items to use instead of three felt a bit much to me. So this mod changes that, including updating the visuals to match.

Adding one more deer throphy to Eikthyr makes it fit the theme, so I'm sure you won't mind that.
Reducing the required withered bones from 10 to 3 is a bigger change, so if you want to disable it you can head into the config.

This mod:
- is required to be installed on the server and by all clients
- has server synced config settings that apply immediately if changed with a config manager in-game
- can be uninstalled at any time and all altars will revert back automatically (there are no permanent changes) 
- does not update a Yagluth altar that has a summoning item in one of the two removed slots. Instead, interacting with it will drop the items and then remove the two slots.
