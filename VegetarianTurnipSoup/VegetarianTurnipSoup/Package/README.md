This mod turns turnip stew into turnip soup, replacing the boar meat component with a yellow mushroom.

This fixes two issues:
- there is now a soup progression: carrot soup, turnip soup, onion soup
- the yellow mushroom was literally not used in a single food recipe

This is not a new item, this just renames turnip stew. You can change the new name in the config.

Backstory:

With the release of the hearth and home update, I started a singleplayer vegetarian melee only no blocking playthrough, so I could force myself to learn dodging and not rely on health food and shields. When I arrived in the swamp, I was annoyed to see that I couldn't upgrade my carrot soup, since every food item now wasn't vegetarian.
