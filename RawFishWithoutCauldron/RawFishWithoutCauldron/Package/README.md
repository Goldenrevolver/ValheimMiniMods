This mod allows you to quickly cut fish into raw fish using a knife instead of crafting at a cauldron.

Simply walk up to a wooden or iron cooking station or a workbench and use your knife on it the same way you offer items to boss altars.

This will play a visual effect and use the base game raw fish recipe to turn a fish from your inventory into raw fish, including giving more raw fish based on the quality.

This way you can get cooked fish before Eikthyr again like on release by using the flint knife. Enjoy!

This is a companion mod to [Spearfishing](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Korppis/Spearfishing) by Korppis and based on a suggestion on their github by the user CatMeat.
