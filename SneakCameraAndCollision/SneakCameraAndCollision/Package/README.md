This mod changes the height of the camera and the height of your character while sneaking.

Both effects are configurable in the config. This is mostly for immersion, but the lowered height does allow you to fit into a few holes you couldn't before (especially when using beams) and the lowered camera is useful while building.

There is no protection to stop crouching at a place that is not high enough to stand, but from my testing Valheim seems to be pretty good at dealing with that (no getting stuck or falling through the world). But take that as a warning to not glitch out of dungeons etc..

This mod was inspired by the mod [SNEAKer](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/blacks7ar/SNEAKer/) by [blacks7ar](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/blacks7ar/).
