This mod removes the 8 yellow warnings you get before the main menu. Not a single warning more or less, exactly those specific 8, that's it.

These are base game issues that IronGate is ignoring due to how irrelevant they are.

This mod does not affect warnings from mods and it turns itself off once you reach the main menu. Enjoy!
