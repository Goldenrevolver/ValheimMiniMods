This mod adds two new unique set bonuses to the rags armor and the leather armor. It also adds bonuses to the lesser used capes.

This is a companion mod to my other new mod 'Cape and Torch Resistance Changes - Water and Cold Resistance'.
It also includes the set bonus changes from 'Troll Armor Set Bonus Without Cape, Water Resistant Cape', but not the water resistance changes.

Set bonus changes:

Before we start, you can change the translation of the name and tooltip of the bonuses and disable the set icon in the config.


Leather Armor:

Adds a set bonus for wearing all 3 pieces of leather armor (the one out of deer hide):

While it is technically the best Meadows armor, deer hide is used a lot in the early game, and with Eikthyr not being that threatening on a second playthrough, I wanted to make this armor feel a bit more worth its investment, so we wouldn't skip it.

Quick Feet:
- +10 Run skill (which increases running speed and decreases running stamina consumption)
- an additional -15% running stamina consumption


Foraging Armor:

Adds a set bonus for wearing the 2 pieces of rag armor (the one out of leather you start with), and the Midsummer crown:

You start your journey with only one thought on your mind: Flowers, you need to pick up flowers, and after that... everything else.

Forager:
- increased item drops when picking up certain items from the ground (based on the Staff of Regrowth from Terraria, as well as Terraheim)
- the items include branches, stones, flint, flowers, all berries and non cultivatable mushrooms
- on average you get two items instead of one, you can configure if you always get two or if you randomly get one to three

Also enables the Midsummer crown recipe of 10 dandelions during any season, so you can start your new adventure like described above.


Troll Armor:

The troll armor set bonus is now a 3 piece set, allowing for the use of a different cape without losing the bonus.
I recommend the mod [SNEAKer](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/2093) for an even better set bonus.


Cape bonuses:

Like everyone knows, a cape makes you more aerodynamic. Okay, I got nothing, enjoy! (or disable it in the config)

Deer hide cape:
- 3% increased movement speed

Troll hide cape:
- 5% increased movement speed

Linen cape:
- 10% increased movement speed
