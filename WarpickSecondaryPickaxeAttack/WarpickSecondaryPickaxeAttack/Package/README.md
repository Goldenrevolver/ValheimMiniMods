This mod gives pickaxes a secondary horizontal swipe attack, perfect for hitting stone golems or ore at eye level.

The horizontal attack reuses the axe swing animation, but has the same attack speed as the pickaxe primary attack. Since pickaxes deal more damage when hitting from above, you should still mostly use the vertical attack for mining.

And of course it can still mine!

### Pickaxe Damage in Tooltip:

Just like in my mod [Tree Enemies Are Weak To Axe Damage](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Tree_Enemies_Are_Weak_To_Axe_Damage) for chop damage, this mod optionally adds the hidden terrain pickaxe damage stat to the tooltip. While most of the time, it's identical to the blunt damage of the pickaxe, it's still good to see this otherwise hidden stat.
