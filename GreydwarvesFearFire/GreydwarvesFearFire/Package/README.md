This mod makes all greydwarves fear fire (not only avoid it) after killing the Elder (configurable).

"Their ancient king has fallen. The invader(s) burned him to death and chopped off his head as a trophy. The greydwarves cover in the bushes of the black forest, a new fear unlocked in all of them: FIRE!"

This is a companion mod to my other modÂ [Tree Enemies Are Weak To Axe Damage](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Tree_Enemies_Are_Weak_To_Axe_Damage/).


## General

Some of you may know that greylings and normal greydwarves actually avoid fire, meaning that they pathfind around it. With this mod you can make all greydwarves, including brutes, shamans and even modded greydwarves run in terror when they encounter fire (similar to boars). You can change the fear level for them individually in the config file.

By default, this requires you to have killed the Elder, as well for the greydwarf to be innately weak to fire (so it does not affect some kind of modded water or coal greydwarf). You can also change this to update dynamically, so they would for example stop fearing fire when it's raining (since the 'wet' debuff eliminates their fire weakness), but this is disabled by default.

This mod is required to be installed on the server and by all clients.


## Compatibility

It is explicitly  compatible with [RRR Monsters](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/neurodr0me/RRRMonsters/) and [Do Or Die Monsters](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Horem/DoOrDieMonsters/), but can also detect other modded greydwarves and greylings by name (I don't know any other mods that add greydwarves, but I will add explicit compatibility whenever there is a new one).
