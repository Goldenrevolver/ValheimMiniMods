This mod makes all tree based enemies weak to axe/ chop damage, and optionally resistant to lightning damage.

This is a companion mod to my other modÂ [Greydwarves Fear Fire](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Greydwarves_Fear_Fire/).


## Axe weakness

Usually, all enemies are immune to chopping and pickaxe damage. The exception to this is the stone golem which is weak to pickaxe damage.

This mod applies the same principle to the axe exclusive chop damage. So if you got tired of using your torch to kill greydwarves (or it's raining), try using your axe!

Only a portion of the total damage of an axe is chop damage (usually around 50%) and chop damage scales poorly with upgrades.

The weaknesses of the different tree based enemy types are configurable in the config, which is also server synced.


## Display

Since the base game doesn't show you the chop damage of your axe, I added it into the tooltip.

There is also the option to fix the color of the damage number to priorise chop damage over slash damage (that's why trees show grey numbers when using some axes).


## Lightning resistance

Additionally, this mod can also add lightning resistance or even immunity to tree based enemies, if you want to give them a buff after this nerf. While there aren't that many ways to do lightning damage in the base game, I'm sure you are already using quite a few mods that add some more.

The resistances of the different tree based enemy types are configurable in the config, which is also server synced.


## Slash resistance

If that wasn't enough, this mod can also optionally increase the slash resistance of tree based enemies by one level, weakness would turn into normal damage, normal damage into resistance etc., affecting everything from axes to swords to daggers. This is not recommended with the default axe/ chop damage weakness settings!

The resistance increase of the different tree based enemy types are configurable in the config, which is also server synced.

## Compatibility

This mod changes weaknesses and resistances very late, so if it's not the default anymore at that point, this mod does not apply its change for better compatibility.
