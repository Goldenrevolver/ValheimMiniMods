This mod adds a way to obtain and grow blue mushrooms in frost caves and changes food recipes to use it.

We all know the cut blue mushroom item by now, and this isn't the first mod to make it obtainable. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who thought that the frost caves update would add blue mushrooms as the mountain biome mushrooms, but now with mistlands released, it seems this item will not be added for a long while if at all, so that's why this mod exists.

This is a companion mod to my other mod [Vegetarian Turnip Soup](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Vegetarian_Turnip_Soup/).


## How to obtain and farm blue mushrooms

This mod does not generate blue mushrooms in frost caves, because then existing caves would stay forever empty. Instead, it makes those useless annoying buggers, bats, drop them. While bats don't respawn, you don't need to find a newly generated mountain biome after installing this mod, you just need to find a cave you haven't cleared.

After obtaining your first few mushrooms, you can take them back to a frost cave near your mountain base and plant them inside with a cultivator. After that they will continously regrow on the same timer as their red and yellow counterparts. Do be aware that blue mushrooms require a significant amount of free space for their mycelium to get enough nutrients out of the rocky ground. Also you can always remove a badly placed mushroom with the middle click of the cultivator, but be aware that you don't get the mushroom back, so maybe wait one or two harvests.

If you are using [Plant Everything](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Advize/PlantEverything/1.10.0/), then mushroom planting in caves from this mod will automatically be disabled in favor of their system, but you can still obtain them from bats.


## What to use blue mushrooms for

There are 3 config options for food changes which are all enabled by default:
- Replacing the 2 normal mushrooms in the wolf skewer recipe with 1 blue mushroom
- Adding a blue mushroom to the onion soup (read the next point for why)
- Mini food rebalance: Swap the stats of the onion soup and eyescream, then buff both a bit and reduce the amount of greydwarf eyes needed to craft eyescream


## Credit

During the development, I did look at [Plant Everything](https://github.com/AdvizeGH/Advize_ValheimMods) for a general guideline on how to add custom pieces to the cultivator. I only used the base game mushroom pickable and I did not include their picked mushroom prefab or any of their assets. My implementation ended up a fair amount differently than theirs, but I still want thank both Advize as well as bkeyes93 for giving permissions for modifications to Plant Everything and Planting Plus, because this would have taken a lot more time and energy without them.
